#WARNING! This is a typical setting for static calculations! You need modify some parameters according to your job type!
#Tomâ€™s One

SYSTEM=LiMn2O4
#GGA=PE

#Startparameter for this run:
PREC = medium
#ISTART = 0           #job: 0-new  1-cont  2-samecut
#ICHARG = 2           #charge: 1-file 2-atom 10-const, change it to 11 if doing BANDS calculations, 2 for magnetic moments

#Spin-polarized calculation setting:
ISPIN = 2            #spin polarized calculation? 2-year, 1-no
MAGMOM = 8*0 16*4 32*0      #default is No. of atoms * 1. Li was none, 16 Mn atoms with potential for 4 electrons to contribute to magnetism, O has none

#Spin-orbit coupling setting:
#LNONCOLLINEAR = F    #non collinear calculations
#LSORBIT = F          #spin-orbit coupling

#Electronic Relaxation 1:
ENCUT = {ENCUT_value}          #cutoff energy
#EDIFF = 1E-5         #stopping-criterion for ELM
ALGO = Fast 
LREAL = Auto 

#Ionic Relaxation: 
#EDIFFG = -0.025      #stoppint-criterion for IOM
NSW=100                #number of steps for IOM, 0 means static
IBRION = 2          #ionic relax: 0-MD 1-quasi-New 2-CG, -1 means static
ISIF = 3             #2 relaxes ions, 3 relaxes ions and volume
ISYM = 2             #0-nonsym 1-usesym 2-fastsym

#DOS related values: 
#EMIN = -25 
#EMAX = 25 
#NEDOS = 5000 
ISMEAR = 1          #check vasp manual
SIGMA = 0.2
#LORBIT = 10          #produce s,p,d for each atom; change it to 11 if you want to px,py,pz.....
NPAR=4              #number of parallel calculations

#Writing flags:
LWAVE = F            #write WAVECAR, F means not writing
LCHARG = F           #write CHGCAR
#LVTOT = F            #write LOCPOT, local potential, useful in surface calculation
#LELF = T             #write electronic localized function (ELF) 

#LDA/GGA+U  settings (optional) Change the parameters by yourself:
#LDAU = F            #default is false
#LDAUTYPE = 2         #check vasp manual, in mode 2, only 'U-J' is meaningful
#LDAUL = 0 0 0 2      #s 0; p 1, d 2
#LDAUU = 0 0 0 2      #U
#LDAUJ = 0 0 0 2      #J

#Hybrid functional calculations
#PRECFOCK= F          #Fast 
#LHFCALC = F          #default is False
#HFSCREEN = 0.2       
#AEXX = 0.25          #0.25 means HSE06 
#ALGO = Damped
